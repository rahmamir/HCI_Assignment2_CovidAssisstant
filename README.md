# Description (includes screenshots, public Figma URL, video URL): 
The COVID Assistant app is designed to help connect sick and elderly people with volunteers and health professionals in these trying times. Upon logging in through google or a new account, users may view latest COVID statistics, medical articles and general tips to avoid COVID exposure. Concerned clients can also request appointments of available health professionals and volunteers, and chat/video/voice call with them, as necessary. Users receiving appointment requests may accept or decline, whereupon the appointment will be confirmed or cancelled.

# Top Five New Desirable Functionalities:
1.	The ability to automatically recommend setting up appointments with experts that would be helpful to the specific issues of the clients
2.	Use voice recognition for navigation within the app, in order to better help elder users.
3.	Allow doctors/nurses to give valid prescriptions through apps, that are encrypted to ensure security. 
4.	Data persistence for viewing appointments and articles when no internet connection is available. 
5.	Ai-based bot which directs new and existing users on app functionality (useful for elderly) giving tips and general directions. The bot can be turned on or off in the settings.
